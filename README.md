# Scrapping-Python-Olx-With-Regex
Welcome to my personal project. This project aims to extract data from the olx, 
precisely the phone numbers of the advertisers.
The structure of the site no longer allows obtaining the number through a specific place in the html to get around this.
I noticed that the advertisers themselves put the number in the description so I created a regex to cover these different ways of 
writing a number eg: ( XX) XXXXX-XXXX, XX X XXXX XXXX and so on. I am open to new solutions this is just a personal project. 
It is necessary to have python 3 on the machine as well as scrapy: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html.  
Thanks for reading.
